# WnCCPortals

This is a part of WnCC's new initiatives this year. The WnCC page and the managers receive a numerous request from start ups looking for interns from IIT Bombay. We are creating a portal to bridge the gap between students and start ups. Both, companies and students can register with us. The companies looking for interns will be given the list of all the students registered with us along with some basic information about them. They can use various filters and contact the students personally.

The registered students will be sent a mail monthly asking them to update their status. They can choose from the following three categories:
- **Category 1:** "Still looking for an internships."
- **Category 2:** " I've been contacted by a start-up."
- **Category 3:** " I am not looking for internships anymore."
